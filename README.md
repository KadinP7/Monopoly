# The intention of this project was to create a multiplayer text-adventure monopoly game in which up to 4 players (minimum of 2 though since there is no AI yet) would compete with one another to be the last player standing. It is supposed to be as much like the actual game as possible (e.g. same 40 properties as the original). Currently, the game does not function as intended and is riddled with errors.
